# Tree-breadth-first
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
function that Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.We Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”

If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”

If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
