# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
The tree is one of the most common data structures in computer science and the natural way to model certain subject areas.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
in this challenge we will learn how to implement 

1-Binary Tree

Create a Binary Tree class

Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:

pre order

in order

post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

2-Binary Search Tree

Create a Binary Search Tree class


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
preOrder/postOrder/inOrder

O(n) space efficiency

O(1) time efficiency

add

O(logn) space efficiency

O(1) time efficiency

contains

O(logn) space efficiency

O(1) time efficiency


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
Binary Tree

Create a Binary Tree class

Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:

1-pre order

2-in order

3-post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

**Binary Search Tree**

Create a Binary Search Tree class

This class should be a sub-class  of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:

**Add**

Arguments: value

Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

**Contains**

Argument: value

Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
