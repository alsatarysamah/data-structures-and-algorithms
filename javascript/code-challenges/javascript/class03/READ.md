# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A Singly Linked has nodes with a data field and a next link field ,the traversal can only be done using the link of the next node.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
in this challenge we learned 

1-how to creat linked-list

2-how to insert at the beginning of linked-list

3-how to loop through linked-list

4-how to desplay content of linked-list


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
**insert(value)**

O(1) space efficency

O(1) time efficency

**includes(value)**

O(1) space efficency

O(n) time efficency

**toString()**

O(1) space efficency

O(n) time efficency

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

1-insert(value) method that insert new node at the beginng of linked-list

2- includes(value) method that Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

3- toString() method Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
