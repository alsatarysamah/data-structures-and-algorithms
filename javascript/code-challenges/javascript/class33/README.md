# leftJoin  function
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

Write a function called left join

Arguments: two hash maps

The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.

The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
